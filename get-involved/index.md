# Thank you for your interest in supporting Scott's campaign in the upcoming election.

Raising awareness of the election and promoting Scott as the best candidate is crucial for the success of Scott's campaign. People will need to be informed and encouraged to vote.

There are several ways you can get involved to help support Scott's campaign.

Deliver Leaflets
----------------

We are looking for volunteers to help deliver Scott's campaign leaflet through the village. Please email us at [info@scottforlmpc.com](mailto:info@scottforlmpc.com).

Put up a Poster
---------------

We are working on a poster for you to put up. Please email us at [info@scottforlmpc.com](mailto:info@scottforlmpc.com) for details.

Social Media
------------

Social media is fantastic for raising awareness.

We're focussing on Facebook for the campaign. We have [a page set up](https://www.facebook.com/ScottForLMPC){:target="_blank"} which you can share, and we will also be producing Frames for you to add to your Facebook profile picture.

Please also share on other forms of social media (e.g. Tiwtter, Instagram) as you wish. Let us know via email at [info@scottforlmpc.com](mailto:info@scottforlmpc.com) if there are any media assets you need to help with this.

Spread the Word
---------------

Talk to people, remind them when the election is, and tell them who you're voting for. Create a buzz!

And Don't Forget to Vote!
-------------------------

The most important thing is that we get votes for Scott in the ballot box. Please vote and encourage your friends and family to do the same (as long as it's for Scott!).
