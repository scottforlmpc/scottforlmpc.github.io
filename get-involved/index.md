# Thank you for your interest in supporting Scott's campaign in the upcoming election.

Raising awareness of the election and promoting Scott as the best candidate is crucial for the success of Scott's campaign. People will need to be informed and encouraged to vote.

There are several ways you can get involved to help support Scott's campaign.

Put up a Poster
---------------

We have prepared two posters for you to put up.

+ [Poster 1](poster-1.pdf)
+ [Poster 2](poster-2.pdf)

Please feel free to print these yourself and put them up, but please make sure you have permission to put the poster up.

Alternatively, we have some printed copies we can let you have. Please email us at [info@scottforlmpc.com](mailto:info@scottforlmpc.com) for details.

Social Media
------------

Social media is fantastic for raising awareness.

We're focussing on Facebook for the campaign. We have [a page set up](https://www.facebook.com/ScottForLMPC){:target="_blank"} which you can share, and we will also be producing Frames for you to add to your Facebook profile picture.

Please also share on other forms of social media (e.g. Twitter, Instagram) as you wish. Let us know via email at [info@scottforlmpc.com](mailto:info@scottforlmpc.com) if there are any media assets you need to help with this.

The Vote Scott logo is available in [high resolution](/img/vote-scott-500x500.png) which you are free to use.

Spread the Word
---------------

Talk to people, remind them when the election is, and tell them who you're voting for. Create a buzz!

And Don't Forget to Vote!
-------------------------

The most important thing is that we get votes for Scott in the ballot box. Please vote and encourage your friends and family to do the same (as long as it's for Scott!).
