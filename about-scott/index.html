        <h1>My name is <strong>Scott Powell</strong> and I have registered as a candidate for the by-election for the position of Parish Councillor in Long Melford.</h1>
        <p>You are probably asking why I would ask you to vote for me?</p>
        <p>Well, I am very proud to say I was raised from a young age in the village and would class myself as a “Melfordian”. I live in the heart of the village with my partner and our four children - three are still at Long Melford Primary School.</p>    
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>I am a team member for the Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service, stationed in Long Melford and I like to think I am already an active member in our community.</p>
        <p>Melford is my home and I think we have a very strong community, with the village a really attractive place for residents, businesses and visitors. In my spare time I enjoy being outdoors with the kids, walking our two dogs and cycling. I am keen to get more involved in with Parish projects and to take an active part in our ever-expanding village.</p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>For me, family is the most important thing and I am proud to have lived in this village since I was a small child. Having seen it change and grow over the year, I would like to play my part as a Councillor on the Parish Council and to help it continue to be a great place for families.</p>
        <h2>Vote!</h2>
        <p>So, please vote for me in person on 6th May, or you can vote by postal vote if you lodge the necessary form with Babergh DC before the deadline of 20th April.</p>
        <p>I want residents to see me as a person that will support and listen to them and make a difference.</p>
