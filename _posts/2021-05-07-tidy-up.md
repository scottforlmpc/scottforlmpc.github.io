Thank you again for your support over the last few weeks. Scott has really appreciated all the positive comments and messages of support and good luck.

We don't know exactly when the results will be out, but [according to the Babergh website the ballots will be counted on Monday](https://www.babergh.gov.uk/elections/current-elections/#count){:target="_blank"}.

This morning we went out and did a tidy up of the posters we'd put up, some of which had blown down in the wind. We think we found them all but if you come across any we've missed then please let us know and we'll come and collect them.

Thanks again, everyone. Scott and his campaign team wish you a very pleasant weekend.
