The Vote Scott Powell posters are printed and they look great!

If you would like a poster to put up in your window or garden to help spread the word about Scott then please get in touch and we can drop one off to you.

We can also deliver a poster-on-a-stick to hammer into your garden if you'd like one of those. 

Please message us on Facebook or email us at [info@scottforlmpc.com](mailto:info@scottforlmpc.com).

When messaging us please state whether you'd like 'the orange one' or 'the white one' and whether or not you need it to be laminated for outdoor use.

Alternatively, you can print your own. Visit the [Get Involved](https://scottforlmpc.com/get-involved/) page and download the PDFs of the posters.

Thank you again for your support, Scott really appreciates it. Let's keep going and get the Vote Scott vibe out there!
