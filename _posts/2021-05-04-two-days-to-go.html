<p>We're nearly at 6th May with just one full day before it's election day. On Thursday, one of the things to vote for is for the single vacancy on the Long Melford Parish Council, and there are only two candidates running (Scott Powell being one of course!).<p>

    <p>If you're undecided on whom to vote for then check out:</p>

</ul>

<p><br />And it's never too late to get your <a href="/articles/2021/04/facebook-frames/">Facebook Profile Frame</a>!</p>

<p>If you've decided on Scott already then please keep spreading the word to friends and family. There's still plenty of time before election today to rally some more support.</p>
