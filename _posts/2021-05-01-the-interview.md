You've seen the orange posters and now you know there's a man called Scott Powell running for election to the Long Melford Parish Council. But who is he and why should you vote for him? I put a few questions to Scott that will hopefully help you to make up your mind.
===

What's your name and where d'you come from?
---
My name is Scott Powell. I was born in Bury St Edmunds and we moved to Long Melford when I was 4 years old, so I'm not quite Melford born-n-bred but I grew up here and chose to stay here.

What's your favourite aspect of life in Long Melford?
---
For me it's the village lifestyle and the open spaces we have both in Long Melford and all around us. It's a beautiful, clean, safe and well kept village. At weekends we enjoy family walks and bike rides.

We have a close and friendly community here. I enjoy getting stuck in to the community, not just with the Fire Service but also just helping out where I can. I've helped out with the Big Night Out and the football club, and [last year after the storms I helped clear up trees that had come down and were blocking the road](https://www.facebook.com/john.nunn.5496/posts/3007475735937880){:target="_blank"}.

What motivated you to run for Parish Council?
---
Well like I just said, getting involved in the community is important to me. I have four kids growing up in the village and I want to be a part of shaping the village they'll grow up in.

Lots of different types of people live here. I'm a family man and know lots of people in the village so I think I'd be a good person to listen to what people around the village want and represent them. In particular, Long Melford is great for families and I want it to continue to be that way.

Which of the Parish Council's current projects would you be most keen to get involved with and why?
---
The most obvious one is the Emergency Planning Group. This is right up my street being a firefighter.

Facilities for children and teenagers is also something I'd like to get involved with. More playground equipment is already being planned by the Parish Council, but teenagers need something for them as well. My kids won't be little forever so I'd like a safe environment for them when they get too big for the playground.

Benches and Melford in Bloom as well. I've already been involved with the Melford in Bloom project and I think it has really transformed the look of the village. Now we need more benches so people can sit and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.

Do you have any other personal areas of focus for things you'd like achieve if elected?
---
I'm really into the history of the village, so I'd like to see more signs about the history of the village. The Long Melford Museum and Heritage Centre and the Long Melford Historical & Archaeological Society have lots of information on the village's history. I think it would be great to get some of that as signs and plaques dotted around the village.

Also, on a similar theme, more signs about the trees and wildlife down the old railway line would be great for the Forest School at Long Melford primary, but would also be interesting for everyone else as well.

OK, time for the big one... housing, traffic and parking are the big issues on people's minds. What are your thoughts on these issues in Long Melford?
---
Haha! Thought I'd got away with that one. When it comes to really big issues a lot of them are out of the direct control of the Parish Council, so I don't want to over-promise!

The Neighbourhood Plan is getting finished now which means the village has a plan in place for housing. When it comes to housing I think the most important thing is to be welcoming to people that move here. Everyone's house was new once.

Parking is an issue that seems to be getting worse and I know that's already being thought about by the Parish Council. I'm keen to get involved in that but I don't have a solution for you right now!

I'd like to see more walking and cycling links in the village, so at least people can get around safely away from cars, especially for people with children. This is another Parish Council project I'd like to get involved with.

Desert Island Disc: If you were accidentally locked in the Parish Council office, which album or film would you choose to get you through?
---
I wouldn't even bang on the door to be let out, I'd just watch Line of Duty on repeat!

*(ed. Technically that's not a film, Scott, but I'll let you off)*

The pub question (thanks to Linzi Shaw for the question): Which is your favourite pub in Long Melford, what are you drinking and what are you having to eat?
---
Honestly I couldn't pick a favourite. They're all great!

For food it's got to be a burger. I think they all do that don't they?

I'm not really a big drinker, but when I do it's a light ale - Nethergate has some great ones.

Burger, eh? Fries, wedges or chunky chips?
---
Chunky chips. With mayo.

*(ed. Correct!)*

Any closing words?
---
Please vote! No, wait. Please vote for me!
