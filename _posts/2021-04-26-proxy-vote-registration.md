Tomorrow (Tuesday 27th April) at 5pm is the deadline for registering for a proxy vote.

A proxy vote enables you to appoint someone you trust to vote on your behalf.

If you want to vote by proxy in the Long Melford Parish Council election then you need to register this with Babergh Council by 5pm tomorrow.

To register, visit [https://babergh-self.achieveservice.com/service/Vote_By_Proxy_Application](https://babergh-self.achieveservice.com/service/Vote_By_Proxy_Application){:target="_blank"}.

Please pass this message on to any friends or relatives that may feel more comfortable having someone vote on their behalf.

Thank you for your support!
